Plan:

do the fermyon examples so I know how to install gems in a wasm
make a kubernetes-operator that has a few things:

* serves web interface
* takes a fluxcd/pkg name as part of a spec in operator style
* the interval says how often to perform a collection
* the collection process runs the gammo wasm module

* the user should also be able to fetch the latest number from in their browser
* we need to account for rate limiting, if the rate limit is hit we should be able to discard that as an error
* it should be possible for the user to show or discard errors in their browser
